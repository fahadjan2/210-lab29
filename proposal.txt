Project Overview
My program aims to simulate the data of a restaurant over the course of every month, demonstrating how a business can change over time.

Implementation
The std::map will be used with the restaurant's name as a key, and then inside, three std::lists representing the menu items, current employees, and purchases made.

Simulation
The simulation will cycle every month, for each time period, of which employees and menu items can change, and so can the total purchases made each month.
